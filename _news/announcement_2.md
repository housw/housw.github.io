I passed my doctoral examination today! Many thanks to Wolfgang for supervizing me in the past years!

This is the cover page of my dissertation, the photo was taken by me, this is the view outside of our student office.

<div class="col three center"  id="Dissertation_coverpage" style="height:950px;border: thin solid grey">
    <img class="col three center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Dissertation_coverpage.png" style="width:500px;height:900px;" alt="" title="the front page of my dissertation"/>
</div>

<br/><br/>


And this is the acknowledge page, many thanks for all your support!

<div class="col three center"  id="Dissertation_acknowledgement" style="border: thin solid grey">
    <img class="col three center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Dissertation_acknowledgement.png" style="width:500px;height:900px;" alt="" title="the acknowledgement part of my dissertation"/>
</div>

This is my Ph.D. hat, which probably needs days of work, I love you guys. 

<div class="col three center"  id="PhD_hat" style="border: thin solid grey">
    <img class="col three center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PhD_Hat.JPG" alt="" title="my Ph.D. hat"/>
</div>

And this is the final slide of my presentation, the background is a Christmas card Claudia sent to me in 2017:
<div class="col three center"  id="Claudia_Christmas_Card" style="border: thin solid grey">
    <img class="col three center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Claudia_Christmas_Card.png" alt="" title="the Christmas card from Claudia"/>
</div>

As she said, these words fit me very well:

> Life is like the ocean, it can be calm and still, or rough and ridig, but in the end, it's always beautiful.

Thank you, Claudia!
